## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes
Favorite Applications List:
-> Instagram (Favorable features include: being able to change to night mode, the organization of the profile page on the app, and the ability to mute unwanted posts/comments.)
-> Amazon (Favorable features include: the organization of the app overall, the ability to easily find a purchase made from years ago, and the various options of merchandise that are available while shopping.)
-> MyCafÃ© (Favorable features include: the fact that I enjoy playing the game, there are no ads (ads are only watched by choice for extra rewards), and there is a ongoing storyline for the game along with new recipes constantly being added to keep the game interesting.)
-> Apple Music (Favorable features include: the variety of music that is avaiable, the separation of music that is clean versus explicit, and the ability to have the night mode feature.)

As far as an app that I think would be cool to create, it would be one that could generate meals. Because I am a picky eater, I only eat certain foods so the app could take user input to create meals. The user will provide a main protein and side dishes and the app will create the meal and possibly suggest beverages that could go well with the meal.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I did not have any challenges while bulding this app when it came to the basic instructions. I did, however, try to incorporate changing the color of the text, but I did not succeed. I believe that I will be able to implement it with more practice.
